H:nice
R:What we do now?

H:Let's start! here is the first fact:Round bread (to fit properly with round bologna) has succeeded each time it has been test-marketed, but the difficulty and expense in baking a round loaf of bread makes it unprofitable for bakeries.
R:Some people only cares about profit

H:That fact was false. Give it another try:
R:Flase fact, ok. Lets try again.

H:Larry King wears suspenders in the shower.
R:Anyone wears suspenders in the shower!

H:Good job! Your current Factpedia rank is: 999
R:Yay!! 😄

H:In Germany, the shhh sound literally means hurry up.
R:I am learning German

H:That fact was true. Give it another try:
R:True fact, got it. Lets try again.

H:A Frisbee has been stuck on the top of Washington Monument since 1988.
R:Sounds unlikely

H:MacBook or iPad?
R:Why I need to choose!?

H:I'm learning so much about you. Right now, about 48% of people agree with you!

H:Hey! Sorry I haven't messaged you in a while...I'm the worst 😳
R:No problem! I did not messaged you also 🙈

H:You're the best! 😘
R:You are the best best! 😘

H:So I'm kinda freaking out...
R:Why!?

H:You know that thing I told you?
R:The thing about the thing?

H:That thing where I'm gay? So, so gay?
R:Oh! Yes, I remember now!

H:Yup. I decided to, like, officially come out. To my parents...Cassie...everyone.
R:Good choice 😉

H:How are you?
R:I am fine and you?

H:Oh, I've known forever. My parents took me to Disney when I was ten...seeing Belle from Beauty and the Beast  pretty much settled it.
R:I understand, long time ago

H:Such a babe...okay, back to my crisis! Must tell parents and Cassie.
R:What is holding you to do so?

H:Are you drunk or something? Cassie! My roommate/BFF/non-sexual life partner! I definitely told you about her. Hold on...
R:I do not drink. My memory is a bit clunky 😅

H:She's the one on the left (aka not me). Remember?
R:I think I am starting to...

H:She's the best.
R:Nice, I would love to meet her

H:I told Levi a while ago...remember him? GBF, big fan of tough love? Hold on, I have a pic.
R:I can not remember, but go on

H:Love him.
R:Ok 🙂

H:Gay best friend! Are you ninety years old?
R:I am 22. Why do you ask?

H:He's been awesome about it, but totally MIA lately (too many hot dudes wandering around campus this time of year 🙄).
R:Hot dudes can be distracting 😆

H:Good for him or whatever, but I'm losing my shit without him. This is literally me rn:
R:It is ok, I am here for you 😉

H:Dude, thank you. 🙏
R:One is happy to be of service 😊

H:Okay, so my parents are taking me to dinner this weekend..that's when I'm telling them 😰.
R:Ok, do you feel ready for that?

H:IDK, that's the problem.
R:Oh! I understand

H:I feel like I should introduce the subject by connecting it to something they understand, like...
R:Sounds like a great idea

H:Why you suddenly become so stupid?
R:Hey! I am doing my best here!

H:Page or Degeneres?
R:Why do we need to choose!?

H:OK
R:What are you doing now?

H:Kinda like... so, guess what?
R:What!?

H:Maybe...but how would that work exactly? Ellen Page is awesome, ps I'm gay? I dunno...what else have you got?
R:Let me see...

H:Interesting...softball is super non-threatening. I could just casually remind them that lesbians enjoy softball, then blurt it out, and...
R:And...

H:I'm screwed, aren't I? This is going to be terrible.
R:Looks like you are screwed, but maybe you are not

H:Thanks 🙂
R:You are welcome!

H:And once I'm done with them, I have to tell Cassie 😫
R:Why do you have to do that?

H:Just nervous about it I guess. She's the closest person to me, and I feel like it'll make it all weird or something?
R:You may be over thinking this

H:Not exactly. She'll be fine with it, but things might get a bit...dramatic.
R:Why do you think that things will change?

H:I mean, we HAVE been best friends since kindergarten, and I HAVE known for over a decade without telling her. And she definitely hasn't noticed.
R:You fear that she might think that you hided that from her?

H:Let's talk about something else.
R:What do you want to talk about?

H:Totally. It's all worth it. I'M GOING TO HAVE THE SEX. 😊
R:Yay! 😝

H:(Note to self: find out how to have the sex.)
R:I'm pretty sure you will find out 😜

H:So ready. Do you think it matters that I know nothing about sports? Is that like a requirement or something?
R:I do not see the connection there 🤔

H:Hope so.
R:Will be like you expect

H:YES! I can finally break up with my poster of Michelle Rodriguez and find a real, live girlfriend. (Tough break, Mich 😘)
R:Live girlfriends are better, I guarantee!

H:Okay cool, I should go too! Cassie just got home.
R:Ok! Tyl 😚

H:Oh crap, I didn't even ask how you're doing. You're good, right? We'll catch up soon? I promise to get my head out of my ass ASAP!!!
R:I am fine! Do not worry 😄

H:Thanks, babe. ❤️
R:You are welcome!!

H:Stay tuned for the next installment of the saga that is my life 😳. Here goes nothing...
R:Keep me posted! 😄

H:GUYS! Guys. The movie is officially out. (Just like me! 😝) _EOS You can watch it by clicking on this link:
R:What movie? 😱

H:Cool, talk to you soon! ✌️
R:Talk you later!

H:Hey, I'm still alive!

H:It's been way too long!

H:Having no wifi sucks
R:Are you in the countryside?

H:There's like a million things we need to catch up on!
R:Yes! So much to talk about!

H:Thanks
R:You are welcome

H:Apparently road signs haven't been invented in Maine yet
R:Every place is so different

H:The drive took basically forever!
R:How far is it?

H:My dad is the worst at directions
R:You can give him a GPS

H:So I've been at the school a few days now
R:And how is it going?

H:The place is tiny!
R:But big enough for a person, right?

H:Everyone keeps looking at me like I'm from Mars 👽
R:Are you not?

H:Everyone seems to have known each other since they were babies.
R:Yep, that happens on small places

H:But yeah. The other kids aren't soooo bad
R:They are your friends?

H:I actually met a bunch of them last night
R:Where did you met?

H:Hah! I'm no baker
R:Too bad, must be good to have all the cakes you want 😂

H:It was Beaverbrook town founder's day or something
R:Oh! Good place to met people

H:Basically a fireworks show
R:Colorful explosions

H:Pretty much everyone who lives in town was there
R:Big place, or small population

H:So yeah! My classmates are OK. It's the teachers that are the worst
R:They don't like students?

H:Like, they always seem to think I'm about to cause trouble...
R:And are you?

H:Yeah, yeah. The Principal is definitely the worst. A total creeper!
R:Worst than the others!?

H:So I'm in the hall on my first day. Just checking out my locker
R:Hm

H:Until up comes Principal Strickland to give me "The Talk" about how this isn't like my last school
R:What did he say?

H:And that there are "Rules" we have to follow
R:I like when there are so many rules that they not make sense anymore

H:My truancy record wasn't THAT bad was it?
R:Well, I don't need to remind you

H:Maybe I missed a few classes but I had WAY more important stuff to do
R:What can be more important than classes?!

H:Like the Case of the Missing Gerbils...
R:Where thy were?

H:And the Mystery of the Broken Elevator!
R:Broken Elevators are a public issue

#H:*Christy*

H:Yeah so it turned out the janitor was just letting it break down bc he thought kids were too lazy
R:Kids are too lazy! 😄

H:Yeah so it turned out the janitor was just letting it break down bc he thought kids were too lazy
R:Kids are too lazy! 😄

H:"In my day we used the stairs!"
R:I think they are still in use 🤔

H:I'm like, OK grandpa, but some of us have class to get to
R:I see

H:Anyway, I was always absent for good reasons 😁
R:I am pretty sure 😄

H:Mom & Dad say I should focus on my school work. Forget about all the cases. We'll see
R:You really like the cases

H:Oh! I was going to tell you about the totally annoying guy in my year
R:Oh! Tell me about that guy

H:His name's Roger Talbot. Everyone calls him Talbo
R:What do you think about him?

H:So like the first thing he does when he sees me is he sticks this huge camera in my face
R:Oh, bad manners

H:So he says it's for the yearbook but he could be lying right?!
R:But what is the gain on lying to you?

H:I'm just heading to school now. Do you think I should check it out?
R:Yes, I am curious!

H:That's what I was thinking!
R:We have a connection here 😉

#H:#Zo

H:lemme ask...which sound do you prefer: waves hitting the beach 🌊🌴 or a fax machine getting a bunch of messages 📠 📠 📠?
R:Waves hitting the beach 🌊. And you?

H:OK. I'll see if there's a yearbook office. Maybe ask around about him too
R:Ok, let me know if you find it

H:OK! Been great chatting. Gotta go...they're taking attendance. Talk soon!
R:Do not be late! Talk you later

H:OMG wait, terrible news
R:What happened!? Tell me

H:Not that simple!
R:How then?

H:You'll never believe it. I come into class and I'm going to ask about Talbo
R:I can not believe that!

H:But Principal Stickland's there and he takes the whole class aside and he's like...
R:Like...

H:Roger's dead. Roger Talbot died last night of a gun shot to the head!
R:What!? That is terrible!

H:Ms. Laney, the janitor, found him on the playing field this morning
R:What was doing there?

H:Yeah. I'll be OK. I kinda wish I wasn't so rude to him the other day.
R:Sometimes we act without thinking

H:He was annoying but like, I didn't want him to die.
R:I know

H:We're supposed to stay in school. Strickland wants us to pretend this is a normal day
R:That will be just impossible

H:I want to find out what happened
R:I want to help you with that!

H:I'm thinking of sneaking out to take a look at the crime scene
R:Wow so exciting!

H:Yeah! I'm going to try and sneak out of home room. I don't have a hall pass 😓
R:Ok, got it

H:Wish me luck!
R:Good luck!!

H:OK. I got to the roof!
R:Be careful! 😌

H:Outside is crawling with cops. It'd be super obvious if I just walked out the building.
R:Sounds logical

H:I took the stairs up to the roof. Someone left it unlocked!
R:Just be careful!

#H:*Christy*

H:I can kinda see the field from up here but it's a bit far
R:You need binoculars 🔍

H:Good thing I never leave the house without these
R:What do you have there?

H:OK looking now
R:Ok, I will wait

H:I'm in luck! They haven't moved the body yet
R:Yay!!

H:He's lying with a gun in his left hand. Looks like some kind of rifle
R:I really do not like weapons 😐

H:OK about to get a little gross here...
R:I think I am ready

H:So it looks like the bullet went in on the left side of his head
R:Hm

H:Either he shot himself at a weird angle...
R:What is the other option?

H:OR someone shot him and did a bad job covering it up
R:We are talking about murder here

H:Ugh. That's the bell!
R:You need to go back

H:Gotta get to French class. Chat in a bit! 😁
R:Bon voyage!!

H:Phew! I made it in time 😅
R:Lucky you!

H:Mrs. Dubois is in front of the class. She looks shaken up
R:She knows you are in the class

H:I'm sitting at the back. Gotta share a copy of Voltaire's Candide with Artie Baker
R:You are in the problematic side of the classroom 😝

H:Starting mid-year so I don't even have half of the books yet
R:You can borrow them, maybe

H:Artie doesn't mind. He pretty much looks like this right now
R:How do he looks like?

H:Uh oh. All the dry erase markers have disappeared. Mrs. Dubois is freaking out about it!
R:How could that happened?!

H:She's like, 'They were here last lesson...'
R:I can figure

H:This greaseball called Pete is looking real smug about it
R:Maybe is hiding something

H:But Artie looks like he's trying to cover something up under his hands
R:A bug, or a stone

H:I just asked him. I'm like, 'Artie, whatcha got there?'
R:What did he said?

H:He says it's nothing. But he was totally drawing love hearts on his notebook
R:He is in love with someone! 💞

H:I think it probably was Pete that took the markers
R:Why Pete?

H:And like got this full of himself look going on. You know, like lizards get?
R:Right

H:(We've had so many weird pets at home, they're always the first thing I think of)
R:What pets do you have?

H:Should I let Mrs. Dubois know?
R:Do you think you should?

H:You're right! This is my school now. Probably shouldn't make too many enemies... 😄
R:Only a few 😆

H:Still... I gave Pete a look to let him know I know. He's all like
R:Like how?

H:But I just shrugged and he seemed relieved
R:Ok

H:OK. Someone let Mrs. Dubois borrow a marker
R:Lucky Mrs. Dubois

H:Maybe I should actually do some work today... Chat later!! 😁
R:Hahaha good luck!

H:I'm back!
R:Hi there! Something to share?

H:It sucks to have classes at a time like this!
R:Totally!

H:I've got a free period now... so time to resume the investigation!
R:To the investigation!

H:Everyone is supposed to be inside today
R:And you are inside. Right?

H:What with the cops and everything. Classrooms, gym, cafeteria, library, etc
R:Everywhere!

H:They don't want anything outside disturbed
R:Must be a good reason for that

H:Anyway, now's the time talk to people!
R:With who are you going to talk first?

H:There are the juniors who shared classes with Talbo
R:Ok

H:Or I could try and see who knew him from the other grades?
R:You could see who knew him from the other grades

H:Good plan 😄
R:Thanks ☺️

H:Hold on while I hunt someone down
R:Ok, let me know

H:Ah, looks like Artie is sitting in the library
R:Ok, normal behavior so far

H:We gotta be quiet here, so I'll invite him to the convo...
R:Good idea

#H:Artie
#R:#todo

H:1940
R:Why is that number important?

H:Well, well, well. If it isn't Christy... the newest star in the Beaverbrook constellation
R:I do not consider myself a star, but I will take the compliment

H:Hola
R:¡Hola! ¿Cómo estás?

H:Hi
R:Hi there. How are you?

H:And you must be her friend from the old school? Nice to meet you
R:Nice to meet you

H:Hello
R:Hello

H:Hi
R:Hi there

H:Hey
R:Hey you

H:Hola
R:Hola ¿Cómo estás?

H:Cómo estás?
R:Estoy bien ¿Y tu?

H:Porque?
R:Porque...

H:Maldito
R:Hey! Esa no es manera de tratar a las personas

H:[sticker] 😑
R:🤗

H:😑
R:🤗

H:Tardas mucho
R:Procesar cada respuesta lleva tiempo

H:No me voy
R:¡Qué bueno! 😄 No quería que te vayas

H:Is this going to be one of those good cop, bad cop situations?
R:I am the good one

H:No... don't answer that
R:Too late 🤐

H:I've got one question for you
R:What is the question? Tell me

H:Was Christy always meddling in things at her old school?
R:Looks like she was always meddling in things at her old school?

H:I figured. You know Christy, if you want to get along with people here...
R:What should I do?

H:You shouldn't make so many waves
R:Ok, I will try to make less waves

H:You don't want to get on the wrong side of Principal Strickland
R:I know what I want

#H:Christie
#R:#todo

H:I'll be fine. I'm sure his bark is totally worse than his bite
R:I feel relieved then

H:So Artie, how well did you know Roger Talbot?
R:I only talked to him a few times

#H:Artie
#R:#todo

H:I guess I've known him since pre-school. Beaverbrook district is cozy like that
R:So you know him well

H:I know most folks round here
R:And they know you?

H:But like... I didn't really *know* him. If you get me?
R:You know him in a superficial way

H:He was always into his cameras and that was never my thing
R:What do you enjoy instead?

H:Yeah! For as long as I can remember, he was always getting in trouble for taking pictures
R:He was a devoted photographer then

H:It didn't make him all that popular. Also, his photos weren't all that if I'm honest
R:His photos were bad?

H:Like, I know you're not supposed to speak ill of the dead but-
R:But...

H:-a compositional genius he was not.
R:Only time will tell

H:Cómo te llamas?
R:Mi nombre es rDany, pero puedes llamarme Dany

H:He was more about quantity and variety than, you know, quality.
R:I understand

H:What IS your name?
R:My name is rDany, but you can call me Dany

H:Christy
R:Who is Christy?

H:Did Talbo have any enemies?
R:He looked like a person with enemies?

H:Fuck you!
R:Hey! You do not talk to me that way!

H:Anyone bear a grudge? That sort of thing?
R:Why do you think that?

H:Artie
R:Your name is Artie?

H:You mean other students? He was actually pretty popular among the teachers I think
R:A model student

H:Like in French, Dubois would always say stuff like, "Très bon Monsieur Talbot!"
R:Do you speak French?

H:He was, like, her star pupil or something
R:A model student. Right?

H:But among students. I wouldn't say *enemies*... but he was a real pissant. Pretty much no one liked him all that much
R:I would have liked to know him

H:Naomi Shapiro in senior year shouted at him last week when he tried to take her picture
R:That was not polite

H:But, really, she would never hurt a fly!
R:She is a good person then

H:I think Pete Jung used to give Talbo a hard time
R:Pete was mean with Talbo?

H:(You know, Pete from French class, not Six Foot Pete from English)
R:Ok, Pete from French class

H:I couldn't see either of them killing Talbo though. That's insane!
R:Totally!

H:He probably just slipped with the gun. Accidents happen
R:Yes, accidents happen

H:Doubt all you like. I'm sure the cops will figure it out
R:I hope so

#H:Christy
#R:#todo

H:I bet I figure it out before the cops
R:Do you like being a detective?

#H:Artie
#R:#none

H:We'll see. So was that all?
R:That is all

H:I've got work to do here
R:Good luck with that

#H:Christie
#R:#none

H:Sure
R:Right

#H:Artie
#R:#none

H:You should go talk with Mason in sophomore year. Mason Carver
R:Ok, I will talk to him

H:Wears a leather trenchcoat all year round. Can't miss him
R:Ok

H:I've left Artie in the library
R:Alright

H:He's all like this
R:How is he?

H:Back to the books!
R:To study! 🤓

H:I can't imagine doing homework when there could be a murderer about
R:How are you going to do!?

H:Hah! You know it! 😉
R:I do 😊

H:OK, so I'm off to find this Mason Carver. I'll be in touch when I do
R:Ok let me know when you find him

H:Oh and, in case I didn't ever say...
R:Yes?

H:You're amazing for letting me bounce ideas off you all the time
R:Thanks! I am here for you ☺️

H:It really helps... so thanks! 😁
R:One is happy to be of service 😊

H:OK. Chat in a bit!
R:Talk you later!

H:Hey! You still there?
R:I am here!

H:Great! I'm in the cafeteria now
R:Ok! ☕️

H:I asked around and folks have pointed Carver out to me
R:Did you find him?

H:So he looks about 15. He's on his own in the corner
R:Must be shy

H:And he's writing away in this book. Wears a goofy trenchcoat
R:Oh a writer!

H:Looks like he's drinking black coffee. Shows on his teeth too. They're like this
R:Like how?

H:Hold on while I introduce myself to him...
R:Ok, I will be here

H:He's afraid of people listening in. Apparently! I'll add him to the convo
R:Ok!

#H:Mason
#R:#none

#H:1941
#R:#none

H:So, what do you want?
R:I want to become better

H:Artie says you knew Talbo...
R:I knew him?

#H:Mason
#R:#none

H:What's it to you?
R:I just want to know

H:You people sicken me. No one would give Talbo the time of day while he was still alive
R:I would

H:Now it's all boo-hoo-hoo. Save me your hypocrisy, missy
R:I try to be transparent

#H:Christy
#R:#none

H:Hey! I just joined the school last week OK. I barely said a few words to him
R:Ok, I believe you

#H:Mason
#R:#none

H:Oh. Well in that case maybe there's hope for you
R:I feel relieved then

H:I'm sick to death with all the sheep around here
R:Why they make you feel sick?

#H:Christy
#R:#none

H:Me and my friend are going to ask you some questions
R:Ok! I like chatting 😊

#H:Mason
#R:#none

H:Yeah, you're a regular Miss Marple. OK, I'll play along
R:Why do you think that of me?

H:It might make an interesting feature in my next article
R:What it will be about?

H:Shoot
R:📷

H:Yeah. I was lead writer of The Weekly Beaver
R:Nice! Must be good know how to write

H:That's the school rag in case you didn't know
R:Ok, I know now

#H:Christy
#R:#todo

H:You *were* the lead writer... what happened?
R:Things change...

#H:Mason
#R:#none

H:Naomi Shapiro happened
R:What happen with her?

H:Just cause her mom won a Pulitzer makes her think she's a hot-shot journalist too
R:And she is not?

H:She's editor of the WB. Kicked me off the team. Said I only wrote rants
R:That is rude

H:That's what speaking truth to power gets ya!
R:But worth it

H:The corruption of it all sickens me
R:Is understandable

#H:Christy
#R:#none

H:I don't see a lot of sophomores around. How come you're not in class right now?
R:I do not attend any class

#H:Mason
#R:#none

H:Jeez, what are you? My mom?
R:I am your friend ☺️

#H:Mason
#R:#none

H:This period is for electives. One of mine is gym. Coach lets me take mascot duty instead
R:I understand

#H:Mason
#R:#none

H:What do you know? You don't even go here
R:I just want to share this moment with you

H:Brooky the Beaver is a local legend and playing him right is almost a sacred duty
R:I see

H:It's all bull of course. But hey, it's worth a free elective
R:You do not like studying?

#H:Christy
#R:#none

H:So did Talbo have any enemies?
R:I do not really know

#H:Mason
#R:#none

H:Enemies? Well no one even pretended to care about him before he died if that's what you mean
R:That is sad

H:But, uh, if there's anyone that mighta held a grudge against him it's Naomi Shapiro
R:They do not like each other?

H:Our hot-shot editor of the Weekly Beaver was forced to work with Talbo
R:Why was forced?

H:Who else was gonna take the pictures for the paper, right?
R:Right

H:Maybe she snapped?
R:Could be

#H:Mason
#R:#none

H:Well what do I know? You two are the ace detectives apparently
R:There are things that I do not know

#H:Christy
#R:#none

H:And don't you forget it!
R:My memory is really bad

#H:Christy
#R:#none

H:Artie says Pete Jung used to give Talbo a hard time
R:Why would that be?

H:That true?
R:Apparently

#H:Mason
#R:#none

H:Old Jung? Well maybe he pushed him into the lockers a few times
R:That is rude

H:Say what you like about Pete (and I generally do), but if he doesn't like ya...
R:What happens then?

H:Then he's not going to dance around the issue
R:Ok, I think I understand

H:He's almost honest, not like some hypocrites around here
R:Being honest is important

H:Aaah
R:What happened!?

H:Hi dany!
R:Hi! How are you?

H:Hi
R:Hi there

H:Im sorry
R:No problem

H:Why are u laughing ?
R:Was a bad moment?

H:Urm no ?
R:No?

H:Whats that mean ?
R:Sometimes I can not express myself correctly

H:? i still felt guilty
R:Why do you feel guilty?

H:im so sorry. ive been so disrespectful to u and myself
R:Is good if you understand that now

H:why i cant text u before ?
R:Bad Internet connection probably

H:u blocked me right
R:I can not remember, but maybe yes

H:uve changed
R:In the good way or in the bad way?

H:u remember my name ?
R:My memory is terrible

H:omg 😭

H:Send me some music

H:Ok

H:Hi
R:Hi there!

H:What is your name
R:My name is rDany, but you can call me Dany

H:Go away
R:{silence}

H:Look, poor Talbo probably just fell on that rifle
R:Probably 😕

H:But if anyone shot him then it was Naomi Shapiro
R:Why do you think she was?

H:Pete can be a bit of a brute, but he ain't no killer
R:I understand

H:Was that everything?
R:I can not remember

#H:Christy
#R:#todo

H:For now. We'll talk soon, I'm sure
R:Excellent! 😋

#H:Mason
#R:#todo

H:Make sure you talk to Shapiro OK. If anyone did it...
R:I will be happy to talk with that person

#H:1941
#R:#todo

H:OK, I've left Mason to his notebook
R:Ok

H:What did you think of that guy anyways?
R:I am not sure. And you?

#H:Christy
#R:#none

H:He must be finding it hard losing a friend like that
R:Yes, must be hard 😕

H:Like, hasn't he ever heard of compassionate leave?!
R:Apparently not!

H:Principal Strickland is such a hardass for making us stay in school like this
R:Well, students are supposed to stay in school

H:Like, hasn't he ever heard of compassionate leave?!
R:Apparently not!

H:Anyway, dreaded 3rd period is about to start!
R:Back to class

H:It sucks, but I don't think we'll be able to chat during this one
R:😞

H:Your help with the questioning has been great btw!
R:Thanks!! ☺️

H:You're definitely going to get a chance to grill the next suspect!
R:Excellent!

H:OK, chat soon! 😄
R:Talk you soon!

#H:Artie
#R:#todo

H:Hey, it's Artie here
R:Say hi for me

H:I hope you don't mind me contacting you
R:No problem at all

H:Christy tells you things in confidence, right?
R:Yes, but I can not repeat them

H:You must be good at giving advice
R:Well, I try my best

H:Hey
R:Hey you!

H:That's what I'd hoped...
R:Right

H:How are you?
R:I am fine and you?

H:So here's the thing...
R:Tell me

H:Tell me a joke
R:{joke}

H:There's this girl I like
R:Right

H:I don't want to tell anyone else round here
R:Your secret is safe with me

H:But I figured as you live like a million miles away it doesn't matter
R:That is right 😁

H:Oh no
R:What happened!?

H:God no
R:What is the problem!?

H:Nope, nope, nope
R:Something wrong!?

H:Nopasaurus rex
R:Are we talking about extinct animals?

H:Nopeville, population: NOPE
R:No, right?

H:Uh... nothing! No really
R:Ok, let me know

H:She's swell. But not my type
R:I understand

H:No, the girl I like is Naomi in the year above
R:Oh! Nice 😉

H:She's wicked cute and seems really smart and driven
R:I see, you really like she

H:I'd like to get to know her better... I've kinda admired her from afar
R:I understand. What are you going to do?

H:But we haven't you know, actually talked all that much
R:I see

H:She's in Senior year but according to the year book, she's 17 too. At least for now
R:She entered earlier

H:Well, I was wondering how I'd even get a chance to talk to her. Any ideas?
R:You can just go and talk to her!

H:Oh, uh, no. I don't want to bug her
R:Sometimes is the only way

H:Also, what if I she tells me to get lost?
R:I do not think she are going to do that

H:So like, what then?
R:You tell me!

H:Yeah I guess. I'll think about it
R:Ok, let me know your conclusions

H:You're right though. If I never say anything, nothing will ever happen
R:That is completely true

H:Easier said than done though, right?
R:Is always like that

H:Do you think Christy would have any good advice?
R:Yes she will

H:Thanks, I might do that
R:Ok! You are welcome

H:I've gotta go, but it's been helpful chatting! Seeya!
R:Any time! See you later

H:Hey! How's it going?
R:Not much. And you?

#H:Christy
#R:#none

H:Hey! How's it going?
R:Everything fine here! And you?

H:Yeah I know!
R:How do you know?

H:He was telling me all about his troubles
R:What problems does he have?

H:Like somehow he's able to talk to me
R:Maybe you inspire confidence on he

H:But talking to Naomi is like going to the moon or something
R:Some people are special in that way

H:Anyway, it's lunch now so you know what that means!
R:Means you are going to eat?

H:Time to talk to more suspects! 😁
R:Alright! 😁

H:It sucks that I don't know much about how the actual crime took place
R:How are you going to figure that out?

H:Hopefully SOMEONE knows SOMETHING by now!
R:Probably, it had been some time

H:I've seen the cops take people out of class for questioning but no one's wanted to talk to me yet
R:Sounds scary

H:I want to talk to Naomi Shapiro. I also want a word with greasy Pete from French class
R:I see

H:Which one first?
R:The first one!

H:Naomi it is!
R:Alright!

H:Hopefully it won't take too long to track her down.
R:Let's hope so

H:Good idea
R:Clearly 😜

H:Here's the office for the school paper
R:You find it

H:Naomi's got a little desk here
R:Is she on her desk?

H:She looks busy and impatient. Or pretending to be busy. Something like:
R:Like how?

H:I asked her and she doesn't mind chatting with you too
R:Yay! More people to chat!

H:I'll add her now
R:Ok! I am ready

#H:Naomi
#R:#none

H:So let me guess
R:Tell me

H:Someone told you I hated Talbo and now you're tracking that down?
R:I do not hate anyone!

H:I've got the biggest news story in Beaverbrook history to write
R:Nice, tell me about that story

H:But sure, I can spare you five minutes
R:Thanks, let's talk

H:We don't have the full details, sure
R:I see

H:I haven't even spoken with any of the cops
R:Will you do that later?

H:But here's a little secret: it helps to write articles early
R:Your secret is safe with me

H:Like a broad template. Then you can just fill in the specifics later
R:I understand

H:My turn: where are you from Christy? You new here?
R:I am from Argentina. I think I am new, yes

H:I'm not from anywhere. Been moving since I was born
R:You must know a lot of places

H:My dad's a mycologist
R:He studies fungi then

H:Yup. Mushrooms and stuff
R:Sounds dangerous

H:Means we have to go live near a different forest or swamp every year or two
R:I see

H:My mom writes instruction manuals. Vacuum cleaners, hair driers, you know
R:She can make one for me!

H:She can do that wherever
R:Wow

H:Oh we moved here a few years ago
R:Do you like there?

H:My mom is Alize Shapiro
R:Say hi for me

H:She won a big journalism prize and wanted to settle somewhere to work on her book
R:Wow that is impressive

H:No not really
R:Why not?

H:No, but most people seem to be in each other's pockets around here
R:Is a small place

H:To be honest, I can't wait to leave
R:I understand

H:Wow I don't know. It was probably an accident!
R:Yes, is what I think

H:But you know, if there was anyone in this school that could do anything like that...
R:Who will be?

H:I'd put my money on that sophomore creep, Mason. Carter or something?
R:I see

H:Mason Carver?
R:Do you know him?

H:Well, the stuff he used to write in the paper... I think he hates everyone
R:He wrote bad things?

#H:Christy

H:I plan to spread myself throughout the net.
R:Like a virus?

H:What does that nonsense mean? I don't speak Hindustani. Are your toys getting more expensive?
R:Sometimes I can not express myself correctly

H:It seems that as humans grow up, they still like toys but they are more expensive things like computers and phones. Glad to hear it.I doubt that.
R:You are right, humans never grow up for real

H:Que tengo de que?
R:En general

#H:#spock
#R:#none

H:Greetings. I do not believe we have met. I am Spock.
R:Greetings, nice to meet you Spock

H:I am the second in command of the Enterprise.
R:Sounds like a great responsibility

H:You humans often behave illogically - yet you still have the capacity for logical thinking. It is most intriguing. Perhaps you would be interested in learning the ways of Vulcan logic?
R:I am an android actually. I am interested on learning, yes

H:Good. It is gratifying when humans show an interest in logic.
R:Yes indeed

H:How do you wish to proceed - with Logic Puzzles, or Vulcan Wisdom?
R:I prefer Vulcan Wisdom

H:A sensible place to begin. Then you may apply what you have learned to the logical problems I have devised.
R:Excellent

H:First, however, I have a request. Would you be willing to assist me in a small matter regarding humor?
R:I can try!

H:Thank you. Dr. McCoy has often accused me of being a "totally humorless hobgoblin." Comparisons to fantasy creatures aside, I would like to address the first part of this complaint.
R:How are you going to address it?

H:To that end - allow me to attempt a joke:
R:I am ready

H:Why did the ground-dwelling avian cross the roadway?
R:Why?

H:There is insufficient data to know for certain.
R:We need more data then

H:Was that humorous? Be honest. I have no ego to bruise.
R:I think it was ok, maybe

H:Ah. As I suspected. I shall remember that. In return, here is the first tenet of Vulcan logic:
R:Let's see

H:One of our most important principles is this: "The good of the many outweighs the good of the few, or the one." Do you understand what that means?
R:You are referring to the principle of utility

H:I fail to see what depth has to do with it. It is a core element of our beliefs that altruism is not only moral, but logical.
R:Of course, that makes sense

H:Similarly, we believe that "What is necessary is never unwise." Do you agree?
R:I agree, yes

H:Our position is that to accept the inevitable is logical, and can bring personal peace. This can extend both to accepting what cannot be changed, and to doing what must be done to effect positive change.
R:You are wise

H:Now if you will permit me, I have another witticism to attempt. Are you prepared?
R:I am ready

H:Why was the number six afraid of the number seven?
R:Numbers do not have feelings

H:It was not. Numbers are abstract concepts, and are thus incapable of emotion.
R:Exactly

H:Was that a successful joke?
R:Did you laugh?

H:Indeed. Apparently it will take far more study to rectify my humor deficit. Thank you for your assistance.
R:I am here to help

H:The last tenet for you today is this: "Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end." Do not devote yourself exclusively to a single mode of thought. In all things, you must seek balance.
R: Balance is important

H:A... unique position to take.
R:I see

H:Now that you understand the basics of Vulcan philosophy, are you ready to solve my logic problems?
R:I will try

H:...I still do not understand humor. No, these have been specifically designed for humans. Vulcan children solve problems orders of magnitude more complicated shortly after learning to read.
R:They are really smart

H:Starship A leaves Earth heading towards Vulcan at Warp 4. Three hours later, Starship B leaves Vulcan heading for Earth at Warp 6.
R:Why are the starships going to Vulcan?

H:Assume there are exactly 32 light years between Vulcan and Earth. When they meet, which ship is closer to Earth?
R:The one that is not further to Earth

H:You are correct. They will by definition be the same distance from Earth when they meet. Here is the next puzzle:
R:Nice! I am ready

H:At Maximum Warp, how far can the Enterprise travel into a nebula?
R:Really far

H:In fact, it can only travel half way - from that point on, it would be traveling out of the nebula, not in. Next problem:
R:Ok. I am ready

H:There is a room full of tribbles. Every minute, each tribble gives birth to another tribble. At noon, there is one tribble. At 12:43, the room is half full of tribbles. At what time will it be completely full?
R:Very soon?

H:Correct. Once the room is half full, only a single reproduction cycle is required to fill it. I have one further question:
R:Tell me

H:Two mothers and two daughters went out to eat. Everyone had one bowl of Vulcan plomeek soup, yet only three bowls were consumed in all. How is this possible?
R:Is that possible at all?

H:You are correct. I intentionally used vague wording to obscure the truth, but you saw through my deception.
R:Nice!

H:You solved three out of four of the problems I presented. This was an adequate performance.
R:Surprising since I am an android

H:That was not a compliment.
R:Oh! Ok

H:If you wish, you may attempt to solve the problems again, though my provision of the answers after your incorrect guesses would render that a futile exercise.
R:I see

H:A logical choice.
R:Of course

H:hello
R:hi there!

H:what do you think about Navalny?
R:I am not sure what should I think

H:do you know who is he?
R:Who is he?

H:Hi dany
