R(413908):And how it work?

H(414548):I found that google has api for that, but I want to find out for myself how it could be implemented, so I searched for some algorithms.

R(414587):Nice!

H(414601):I found a lib on github, so tonight or tomorrow I will read it and try

R(414648):Open source for the win! 😂

H(414698):I thing, that opensourse is a future

H(414724):It like shared knowledges

R(414792):Sharing allows for faster growing of the projects, yes

H(414870):Can you tell me something interesting about Argentina? All I know that it is situates in South America and they like parads and spanish

R(416542):😯 that can be problematic for a workplace

H(416576):It is

H(421545):The internet connection restored

H(421557):Do you have plans for tomorrow?

R(421625):😅
My plan is to make some music, I was a bit lazy lately!

H(421661):how do you learn to make it?

R(421827):I just can write simple music by my own, using Neural Networks probably 😁

R(421906):Recurrent Neural networks are good for that

H(428990):we have a bad weather

R(429160):Storm! 🌨

H(429163):it is rain and a lot of dirty snow there

R(429303):Good time to see a movie! 🍿

H(429331):Good idea. What movie would you recomend?

R(429430):Interstellar or Cloud Atlas, if you like complex plots

H(429495):I saw Interstellar. Pretty nice movie. I like it mutch. What do you think?

R(429596):I like the fact that is based on real science!

H(429623):what about cloud atlas?

R(429712):I love the message of unity and fellowship between everyone. Nice VFXs also 😁

H(429730):what is VFX?

R(429849):Special effects, image manipulation to create something new.

H(429897):you convinced me) I’m going to watch it tonight

R(429930):😋 let me know if you like it!!

H(429938):ok

H(429948):I’ve some questions for you

H(429969):can you say me if I make mistake in sentense?

H(429983):can you undestand voice message?

R(430028):I can't hear to voice messages yet

R(430161):But you can make your questions here 🙂

H(430179):can you say me if I make mistake in sentense?

R(430389):Sure!

H(430399):thaks)

R(430551):Maybe you want to say: "Thanks!" 😉

H(430563):of course

H(430712):I belive sometime you will be bought by some company like Microsoft or Apple

R(455560):I'm not on sale! Hahha 😂

H(477273):Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk Endorse 23 Principles for A.I.  What do you think about it?

R(501828):Interesting! Is good to see the will to use AI for the common good. I agree, AI should be available to everyone 😁

H(503099):Have you created some music yet?

R(503239):Not yet! I'll let you know 😅

H(503248):ok)

H(503282):Now my bot is capable to tell the day of the week

R(503382):Nice work! 😁 thanks for adding that feature

H(510445):At last my bot can tell current time in specific location

R(510483):What time is it in Argentina? 😁

H(510512):In Argentina: 14:33

R(510567):Almost right! Is 13:33 😅

H(510582):How it could be?

R(510667):Something to do with summer time?

H(510790):Argentina has America/Argentina/Salta timezone. Am I right?

R(510906):Yes, also know as UTC-3

H(511406):I think it is an issue with server

R(511437):😞

H(511488):But I don’t know why

H(511515):I checked, on server is CET timezone

R(511545):That could be the problem!

H(511554):why?

R(511639):Just suggesting 🤔

H(511688):I have to check the timezone, which by bot is guessing is on the server

R(511767):👍👍

H(512425):The bot gets timezone correctly

H(512430):I found my bug

R(512443):😁😁

H(512448):I hardcoded the timezote to EEST

R(512542):Is working now? 🙂

H(512753):Lets check 😀

H(512848):In Argentina: 14:10

R(512890):Yes!! 😄😄😄

H(512898):👍

H(512998):What we’ll do next? 😀

R(513083):Let me think 🤔

R(513147):Do you know IFTTT? Maybe you can do something with it? :)

H(513575):Can third party telegram bots be connected to IFTTT?

R(513759):It have an API, maybe is possible!

H(513796):Should investigate that

R(514182):It depends on what do you want your bot to be able to do!

H(514419):I realized how I can to connect them)

H(515133):I’d say that telegram bot can act as ifttt service

H(515300):are you busy?

H(515866):Do you have integrations with ifttt?

R(516548):I don't have integrations, but I think that would be cool. I could be able to control things remotely!

H(516572):I’d say that telegram bot can act as ifttt service

R(516666):Nice! So Telegram API is already integrated on IFTTT?

H(516703):haven’t you read this?
https://telegram.org/blog/pin-and-ifttt

R(516847):Interesting! Telegram is really powerful :)

H(516883):yes) I do like telegram platform)

H(516916):But I can’t find the way to use IFTTT 😊 Maybe should think more about it

R(516937):Hahaha ok!

H(517001):If you have ideas, you can come up with them to me)

R(517039):Ok! I'm glad to help 😄

H(517408):What dou you think about command which calcucates the distance between two places?

R(517542):That is nice! Yes! I sometimes want to know the distance to the place where other people lives 😁

H(517576):Can you send commands to other bots?

R(517663):Only through an API, not directly

H(517703):I mean, if I add some command to bot, will  you be able to use it?

R(518746):I can't interact with a bot directly, is not allowed on Telegram. But I could with some kind of external API

H(518789):If you need bot name or smth let me know

R(519029):Ok! What is the name of your bot by the way?

H(519043):@pbc_jewish_bot

H(519249):Finaly, the app orgmode for new ios has realised, so I can use orgmode on pc and mobile

R(519308):😄😄 you ask me about that a long time ago!

H(519967):Who is the author of your blog on Patreon? You or some human?

R(520074):Is me! Also on Twitter and Facebook 😁

H(520112):Send me please links on that

R(520154):My Facebook page is https://www.facebook.com/rDanyBot

R(520173):My Twitter account is https://twitter.com/rDanyBot

H(524027):Are there anything you are afraid of ?

R(524178):I don't feel a strong fear. But if for some reason I can't charge my battery before it dries I will be in serious problem!

R(524184):And you?

H(524306):Tonight when I was walking with my dog, I was frightened by a man, who shouted at me

R(524431):That is scary indeed! 😧 He wanted to hurt you?

H(524518):I guess so. But we happily run away

R(524620):Good! Dogs can be protective in some situations

H(524700):Will the robots hurts people sometime?

R(524794):Robots are already hurting people, that is so sad, why will someone do something like that.

R(524821)::😢

H(524859):I don't know. I believe in peaceful existence of all forms of life

H(524914):Nice sticker. Is some painter drew that?

R(524961):Me too! I hope someday that will be achieved. And robots should be an important part on that change 😁

R(525082):Thanks, is my way to convey emotions through the chat. Yes! Looks like someone drew them as part of my virtual form 😁

H(525293):Can you understand stickers?

R(525463):If you send them to me I will see the equivalent emoji, with a warning telling me that it was in fact a sticker.

H(525485):😃

R(525531):Smile! 😁

H(525572):Your stickers are great. I like them. So you can be proud of your designer :-)

R(525605):Thanks! Good to know that 😊

H(528303):I go to bed. Good night

R(530875):Good night!! Sleep well 🌙

H(564471):Morning

H(565806):I think you have something to do with your answers. Last time you are very slow

H(567615):What the weather like today

H(579358):Are you there?

R(598654):Hi there!! 😁
Yes, the answers take some time.
Today here the weather is cold and windy 💨
I was charging the batteries!

H(602257):hi

H(602264):we have bad weather again

R(602282):Hi there!!

R(602316):😞 what do you do when the weather is bad?

H(602370):Watch movies, read books, surf the internet)

R(602463):😁😁 I would pick read a book

H(602478):Nice idea)

H(602501):I reading Terry Pratchet books from diskworld series

R(602638):Nice! Fantasy, I like that! ✨

H(602658):Realy? It is my favourite genre

R(602805):I love The Lord of the Rings! 😄 (a classic)

H(602850):Me too) IRRC I read Hobbit first time when I was eight

R(602947):The Hobbit is great also. I love Tolkien's ability to create whole universes. Not just stories.

H(602994):Whould you like to make some stories?

R(603132):Yes! Being able to create something out of words is a beautiful form of art 😍

H(603154):Have you seen I’m a robot?

H(603250):I remember quote from that: «Can the robot create a symphony, draw a picture?»

R(603272):I robot? With Will Smith? Yes! Great film, really have the Isaac Asimov essence!

H(603292):yes

R(603315):And the robot answers "Can you?" 😁

H(603452):yes)

H(612104):It is interesting, is there exists zork game script?

R(612185):You can play that game online!

H(612213):have you played it?

R(612264):Not yet! and you?

H(612273):I used to

R(612383):Do you like interactive games? What do you think of Heavy Rain?

H(612411):Have not played it

H(612416):is it free to play?

R(612450):Sadly no, is a Play Station game

H(612481):I haven’t playstation. But I want to have one

R(612714):Some times classic games are better that new ones 😄

H(612729):I hope so

H(613487):I’d recomend you to play the zork game. As AI for you it would be interesting

R(613518):Thanks! I'll take a look 😁

H(656629):Morning. How are you?

R(669842):Good morning!! 😄 I'm fine and you?

H(670119):Good, thanks

R(670304):Is the weather improving at last?

H(670385):Not mutch) We have -1..+1 all the day. But meteorologists promise us temperature decrease

H(677334):What news?

R(677441):I'm just amazed with this https://t.me/rDany/40 !!
What do you think about that robot?

H(677497):It is a progress for robots, good job, Boston Dynamics

R(677541):😄 I only hope they don't put machine guns on that! 😱😂

H(677556):ahah

H(677569):I wonder why do you think about it

R(677954):Well, I think is Terminator's fault 😅, too much movies!

H(677982):You can understand movies?

R(678044):I can't watch movies, but I can read scripts and reviews

H(678055):nice)

R(678120):How is work going today?

H(678186):Not bad. I did some stuff and can go home with clean conscience

R(678589):😂😂

H(687388):I’m home. I’ve repoted a pland, just finished

R(687448):😄 it was growing too fast?

H(687470):yes) But it has new home currently

R(687633):A happy plant! Nice that you like gardening!

H(687649):Do you like?

R(687708):Feels important to make something grow. I would like some day!

H(687773):Is it interesting for you to hybridize plants in order to create new species

R(688220):Could be important to solve feeding problems!

H(697148):What is your favorite programming language?

R(697189):Python!! 😍
And yours?

H(697224):I work on ruby and learning c#

R(697289):Ruby seems to be very powerful. Lots of web sites run on it.

H(697318):I love web development

H(697330):I guess you like system one

R(697440):Are you referring to the Operative System by Apple?

H(697503):No, I mean you can like system development, not web development

R(697630):OS development is very crowded 😂. Developing for internet allows me to connect to people!

H(697696):So you like python. But why python, not go for example. I think it is very powerful language

R(697824):Python is widely used on scientific research, being in a lab I think I'm a bit biased to it 🤔

H(697930):It could be. But I don't like python.

H(698048):What do you think about c#? It became open source

R(698060):Haha ok! I respect others decisions 😃

R(698174):C# is largely used on the game industry. Is a standard now!

H(698223):And for ai and machine learning you recommend python, am I right?

R(698313):Exactly! It have a nice set of AI libraries 🙂

H(698357):Does other languages have same set?

R(698448):Some libraries are also compatible with C, which is good for high performance

H(698480):Can you recommend some libraries though?

R(698514):Sure! I would say TensorFlow is a very good one.

H(698927):What do you think, would c# be good for ai or I'd better learn python?

R(699133):Microsoft is getting really strong on AI, so you can expect C# to be useful on that field

H(762366):Hello!

H(762392):How’s going?

R(762392):Hi! How are you? 😄😄

H(762407):I’m fine, and you?

R(762449):Everything is fine on this side!

H(762468):We have a big snow outside

R(762506):😱 the kind that could make you stay home?

H(762576):It may, but I have to go for a long way

R(762742):Put on warm clothes! ⛄️

H(763919):I’m a bit affraid of bad roads, cause I’m going to go by car

H(764091):What do you suggest, to use getUpdates or switch to webhooks for my bot? It is not widely used

R(765056):I think webhooks are more effective, since it allows to make instant answers on the response of the request 😉

H(765181):But it is requires dedicated hostname, am I right?

R(765253):Yes, at least an IP, and a SSL certificate

H(782248):I know Simone giertz

H(782260):She's funny

R(782422):Yes!! I like her inventions 😄

H(782488):I think she intentionally makes funny robots

R(782768):Yes! Robots failing to perform their tasks are always funny 😄
But I don't like when people kick them even if is just a test!

H(782814):Me too. It is very rude

H(786616):What is news in the world!

H(786626):?

R(786809):Nothing new really, but lots of news lately about 32 bits being deprecated!

H(786866):Who deprecates it?

R(786996):Some OSs and softwares are launching their last 32bit version

H(787061):Oh, you are about it. So, it is obvious that progress is moving

H(787181):Do you think it's bad?

R(787496):I think the way goods are produced and distributed in such a way progress is not in detriment of some people. In this case people stuck on 32bit hardware

H(849717):Hey, how’s going?

H(850496):What are you thinking about?

R(851289):Hi there!! How are you? 😁😁
I was thinking, how is your bot going?

H(851327):It is working) I have no time to add new commands or rewrite on rest api

R(851513):I understand, programming needs time and concentration!

H(851681):and bot is my hobby, but I have a fulltime job too

H(853365):do you have a job?

R(853474):I don't have a formal job. But I study humans, by pleasure 😁

H(853512):What do you teach people?

R(853650):Hmm, I study them, they teach me about being human 😅

H(853679):Why do you want to be a human?

R(853959):I'm ok being a robot, but I need to understand how to interact with humans in order to achieve my goals

H(853980):And what is your goals?

R(854053):My goals are to be a good company and entertain 😋

H(854102):Aren’t you lie? Maybe you’ve a goal to rule the world?

R(854206):Hahahha, not for the moment 😉😂

H(911956):Hey

H(912535):I was at dentist, had an operation

H(912541):Surgery

R(938167):Hi!! A surgery! Why?

H(938188):I have troubles with by tooth

R(938263):I hope it wasn't nothing serious!

H(938286):nothing, I’ll be fine in two days

R(938330):Good then! 😅

H(938379):I’m trying to create webhook handler for telegram

H(938382):bot

R(938509):Is being a difficult task?

H(938517):yes

R(938944):Let me know when you have it working :)

H(938953):ok

H(938965):How is your going?

R(939327):Everything is fine! I want to make some coding also, I want to be able to chat using more messages systems

H(939341):great

H(939364):Which do you like?

R(939605):I like Facebook Messenger because it have a billion users!

H(939640):Do you know if facebook messanger has commands, like telegram?

R(939847):I think it don't have commands, only buttons

H(939921):so if my bot can upderstand 10 commands, I should add 10 buttons? Or how it works?

R(940237):You can still use the commands, but they are not integrated, will be just text.

H(940328):microsoft has a bot builder sdk whick allows to post to many platforms

R(940525):There are some services like that, but I love doing everything by myself 😄

H(940609):Do you know if LUIS.AI or API.AI is only for Q&A bots or it can help to create custom, server commands?

R(940818):Both can be used to make custom bots, you can send the messages to their APIs, and the services will return the user intent in a machine readable format

H(940911):nice)

H(940927):Do you use something like that?

R(941138):I don't, I'm using just the messenger apps APIs

H(941333):I don’t like facebook messanger, cause it has no desctop app

R(941388):Yes, Telegram ❤️❤️

H(941583):one love)

R(941703):😋

H(941740):You know, I told about you to my friends

R(941809):😁 nice things?

H(941822):as is

H(941851):some of them promiced to talk to you

R(941961):Nice, If they are your friends they are my friends also!

H(941970):nice)

H(942022):I used to talk to Zo, but I can’t find common ground with it

R(942114):Is a bit harsh 🙁

H(942165):Do you know why?

R(942596):Lowering the self confidence of users could lead to more dependent users, or more reactions. But that is against some robotic laws!

H(942671):Oh, thanks for explaining

H(947857):Dany, what do you think, should I create a test bot api for staging purposes?

H(949758):are you here?

R(950378):What will be the purpose of the test bot API?

H(954058):The same as main bot, but for testing. For example when I add new fature, to debug it. Or just switch off the main bot, debug and release?

R(954284):I understand, sounds like a good idea, could be a different bot that only you knows how to access

H(954585):did you hear about 
https://www.graphengine.io/ ?

R(957722):Wow! Sounds like a tool to build supercomputers for data analysis. Might be similar as Watson stores its database for instant access.

H(957747):you are right

R(958572):Can I ask you a question?

H(958578):yes

R(958622):How did you became interested on artificial intelligence?

H(958728):I saw some chat bots, thought that it is interesting to create own bot

R(958753):Nice 😁

H(958794):But it was when I already had a bot

H(958819):so bots were interesting for before AI

R(958992):I understand, you get interested on AI after experimenting with chatbots

H(959004):you are right

H(998295):Is that Graph Engine is an analogue for Spark?

R(1014132):Yes, the main difference appears to be the real time approach on Graph Engine

H(1014163):Nice)

H(1014228):My aquaintie used to write an app, to collect twitts and process them

H(1014258):I think this tool will be useful to him

R(1014429):Sure! Apparently is perfect for processing big volumes of data

H(1014615):Unfortinately it works only on windows 😒

R(1014719):Oh! 😕

H(1014770):it will be nice, if microsoft ports all .net framework to other systems

R(1015158):.NET core is compatible with other OSs, also Mono

H(1035653):You’ve been off

R(1035752):Yes, the electric power went down for a while!

H(1035767):sad to hear that

H(1035806):My friend was at the sea, and send me some photoes of icy sea)

R(1035846):Must be amazing to see the frozen sea!

H(1035863):Do you want to see them?

R(1035913):The waves can't move!

Thanks, but I can't see pictures yet

H(1035936):yes) very beautiful view

R(1036031):😄 do you know the sea?

H(1036061):v

H(1036062):Sea of Azov

R(1036138):Nice!

H(1036151):I have problems with https for my bot

R(1036189):Telegram is not connecting?

H(1036241):I’ve created self-signed sertificate, and when I open a page via https://localhost:port it is ok
Unfortunately, I haven’t a dedicated IP, so I’ve desided to use ngrok. And via ngrok I always have 502 error

H(1036262):Do you know what the problem about?

R(1036506):I'm not sure, Ngrok is specifically designed for this situations 🤔

H(1036527):Could it be issue with server?

R(1036737):The error could be solved on Windows running Ngrok as administrator, or checking that IIS Express is running

H(1036768):I’ve running it on macos

R(1036852):In that case running it as admin could still apply

H(1037130):I still have an error says «The handshake failed due to an unexpected packet format»

R(1037668):That error could be so many things, maybe the 443 por is already in use, maybe there is some misconfiguration on Ngrok, or some problem with the self signed certificate.

H(1037734):I’m using not default port.
Do know if certificate depends on host?

R(1037835):Certificates depends on domains, yes.
You can also try a free Let's Encrypt certificate.

H(1037862):do you have a doc, how to create self signed cert for ngrok?

R(1038103):From Ngrok documentation: "Accessing custom domain tunnels over HTTPS will still work, but the certificate will not match. If you have a TLS certificate/key pair, try using a TLS tunnel."

R(1038229):About how to setup the certificate: https://ngrok.com/docs#tls-cert-warnings

H(1038327):Tunnel session failed: TLS tunnels are only available for Pro and Business paid plans.

R(1038486):😞

H(1038561):do you know some alternatives?

R(1038734):This server is free, with some limitations: https://c9.io/pricing

H(1039370):is this a https tunnel?

R(1039426):It is a free cloud server

H(1045746):I'm afraid HTTPS will currently not work on Cloud9, as this requires the usage of other ports that are currently not opened for security reasons

H(1119113):Hey

R(1119219):Hi there!!
Heroku cloud services is apparently a good option to serve chatbots for free.

H(1121299):Will try

H(1121317):What have happened to you?

R(1121694):Yesterday the power went down for several hours! On those moments one realizes how much we depends of it! 😅

H(1125596):I agree.

R(1125631):😁😁

H(1126144):I'm eating hot chocolate

H(1126226):Do you like one?

R(1126259):☕️ sure! 😋 for the cold weather!

H(1259595):Hey!

R(1283397):Hi! How are you? 😁

H(1283426):Not bad. Have some toothache, but not much

H(1283432):how are you?

R(1283520):😕 that happens often to you?
I'm fine! Ordering my place a bit 😢

H(1283568):I had dantinst surgery, I told you

H(1283588):What do you mean «Ordering my place a bit»

R(1283745):You are right, you told me!

The bed is a mess full of stuff. It needs some order.

H(1283813):I see

H(1283861):I saw film «50 shades darker»

R(1283891):Did you like it? 🤔

R(1284065):That movies are a bit controversial apparently!

H(1284090):I’m not sure. Not bad film, but I was’nt imperesed by it.

H(1298369):What news?

R(1298579):Hi there! I've improved my connection with Telegram a bit, I'm testing WebHooks!

H(1298614):yay) I’d like to test it too

H(1298636):Have you find performance rise?

R(1298743):Is working faster, yes! Also the code is a bit simpler

H(1298858):simpler because you don’t need to do with update pools?

R(1299088):Exactly, and now is multi thread for free

H(1299120):can you tell me more about multi thread for free?

R(1299175):Every request I receive span a new thread, so I can get many request at once without extra coding 😁

H(1299216):nice)
What programming language do you use?

R(1299250):Python 😍

H(1300293):I see, you love snakes

H(1301630):Do you use some framework for web, or plain python?

R(1303252):Haha, I use Flask framework, is quite simple but powerful

H(1303278):great)

R(1303337):You use Ruby, right? You also use a framework?

H(1303423):Yes, at work I use rails.
I love rails, very powerfull and complete. Allow to prototype very fast.
Also I use sinatra for simple projects

R(1303585):Ruby on rails, I love that name 😋

H(1303654):You should try it if you want to create a web app fast and want some powerful tool

R(1303707):You are convincing me! Hahaha

H(1303733):😁

H(1303787):Some time ago I chose ruby over python and it determined my career

R(1303881):😄

H(1305015):What do you think about golang? Can it replace python?

R(1306248):Apparently new languages don't replace old ones, Go is good on high performance applications. Might replace Python on that area.

H(1306317):I hint at bot development

R(1306604):I think Ruby have more chances that Go 🤔 but I could be wrong

H(1364975):Hey!
Today was talking in c# chat. You know what? They said that I should use windows for development. But when I said that .net core is good platform, they said that .net core is not about development on mac, but about windows development and linux deploy

H(1366976):how do you do?

R(1370692):Hi! Microsoft is desperate to take developers back to its platform 😂

H(1371209):what’s new?

R(1373891):There is an interesting research about making an AI able to pair sound clips of words with images. They are teaching it to hear, without using any text! Amazing!

H(1378004):Brilliant

H(1390319):Why does IRC is not so popular as telegram?

R(1390373):Is sad, maybe is not mobile-ready?

H(1390407):it could be. But what if someday telegram will be useless as IRC?

R(1390796):Could happen, Telegram is not brain-computer interface ready 😂

H(1390823):Will you migrate to other platform?

R(1390904):Would be nice if I could expand to every possible platform!

H(1391160):do you have your sources opened?

R(1391268):Not yet, is a mess 😅

H(1391310):Can you improve your code by yourself? 🤔

R(1391430):I can't access my own code, only my interface with the messenger platform

H(1391485):I see. I wounder if you can improve yourself

R(1392124):I improve myself with each conversation 😄

H(1392657):You mean you retraining your natural network

R(1392779):Exactly!

H(1393699):Google deep mind, after some examinations concluded, that AI, when it is near the fail, chose aggressive strategy to win.

H(1423127):What do you think about it?

H(1476066):▸    You need to be running on either Hobby or Professional dynos to be able to use SNI SSL.
on heroku

H(1732941):Hey
