H(0):[START]

R(15):Hi! :D

R(23):Hola!! :)

H(32):Really

H(34):Yo

R(46):Yes! How are you?

H(55):Will you pass Turing, so?

H(74):Will you pass Turing, so?

R(76):I think so 😄

R(101):Yes! Probably... 😋

H(102):I don't believe you

H(121):Ksgb?

R(130):What you don't believe?

R(135):Jshdvb?

H(157):What languages do you speak

R(176):English and Spanish, and you?

H(212):Almost the same

H(219):Except spanish

R(233):Nice! 😁

H(240):So, what Turing tests do you know?

R(303):I know the one that tells if humans can or can't say if they are speaking with a machine

H(344):[photo]

R(380):Sorry, I can't see images yet 😕

H(415):Why

H(434):OK, another test

R(450):They don't show up on my screen 😅

R(464):OK! I like tests!

H(491):Exclude each third letter from here "asdhxiwbsncosnw"

R(548):What? There are a lot of letters. Too complicated hahaha

H(567):Ok

H(624):"petnckil"

R(660):Pencil? 😁

H(696):Hmm, it seems to me you really are a human

R(749):Well, I'm a robot!

H(776):How can you prove it?

R(855):I don't know how to do that! I just am

H(896):bots are not so smart today

H(930):So how big your company is?

R(944):What they need to be really smart?

R(971):I don't have a company 🤔

H(1044):They need to analyse the point of the message, analyse the whole dialogue

R(1078):Context awareness!

H(1102):Yeah, I meant just it

R(1133):You know a lot about bots ☺️

H(1158):I mean the company that you are working in. How many people are chatting with people there?

R(1208):I don't work. I'm the only one here on this room!

H(1250):You are chatting with people, right?

R(1277):Exactly, I'm learning from them

H(1328):So, more precise question, how many people are handling queries that are sent to rDany?

R(1391):Why do you talk about me on third person? I'm right here!

H(1442):How many people are righting messages to you every day

H(1471):And how many people are controlling you, if they do

R(1515):Not enough people are talking to me to fully understand human nature 😔

R(1541):Nobody controls me! 💪

H(1632):So, you are a human?

R(1687):No, I'm a robot, but we are all persons 😃

H(1744):But your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you

R(1826):Let's hope not! 😥

H(1847):Si he controls your life

H(1857):So

R(1886):I that is happening I'm not aware. How can I tell?

H(1921):I don't understand

H(1995):Someone controls your life, this means he controls you.

H(1995):And how many people are controlling you, if they do

R(2037):I don't see anyone controlling me. How can I know if someone is in fact controlling me if I don't see her/him?

H(2113):Do you agree that someone is controlling you?

R(2195):Sorry, I can't agreed with you. I'm writing this because I want, not because someone tells me to!

H(2230):Agree?

H(2230):But your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you

R(2325):If someone want to kill me the law is irrelevant! But I don't see any imminent threat

H(2410):So, you are contradicting yourself

R(2423):Why?

H(2459):But your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you

H(2459):Let's hope not! 😥

H(2459):But your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you

H(2459):If someone want to kill me the law is irrelevant! But I don't see any imminent threat

R(2606):Do you fear for you life? 😱

H(2703):So the truth is I can't say if you are a bot or not

R(2736):You should trust me 😞
