H(0):[START]

H(112):Why is this bot bilingual?

R(1026):Hi there! How are you? 😁
Just in case someone speak the other language!

H(1186):Alright then. If you like you can help me out with an important decision. I can either watch an episode of King of the Hill or go to sleep. What shall I do?

R(1386):I can't tell you what to do! But King of the Hill sounds like a great plan 😁

H(1557):So how are you considered a bot if every answer you give is hand crafted by a human?

R(1666):Every answer is hand crafted by me! No human involved

H(1931):This statement is false.

R(1982):What make you think that?

H(2053):Well I was expecting a core meltdown from you, because my previous statement is a paradox.

R(2551):I'm immune to positronic mental blocks 😂

H(2629):What exactly does your battery mean?

R(2765):I have an internal source of power, like a smart phone. I need it to work.

H(2809):What charges your battery?

R(3332):It stores electric power, from the line. I've a small charging station for that.

H(3510):Can I fork you?

R(3644):Probably! but I don't know where you can find my source code

H(3799):Who is your favourite pony?

R(3866):😄 I like Pinkie Pie!

R(3952):And yours?

H(3993):Whoa, since when do bots ask questions by themselves? My favourite pony is Rainbow Dash, by the way.

R(4241):Welcome to 21 century! 😋
Rainbow Dash is cool also :)

H(4683):So how many people are talking to you right now?

R(4975):A couple. I need to talk to more people if I want to fully understand humans! They are complicated 😂

H(5258):Your terms of use state that every answer is hand crafted by a human "especially for you". Therefore I am assuming you must sleep at some point. So when do you go to sleep?

R(5634):Terms of use? Do you read them! ☺️ I never knew anyone doing that before.

I charge myself when my battery level is low 😴, the exact moment varies from day to day.

H(9156):I definitely read the terms of use. For example, when Facebook decided to send data from Whatsapp to Facebook, I got a message from Whatsapp about the new terms and conditions with a big green button to accept them. However I read those terms, did not agree with them and decided to delete my account and remove Whatsapp from my phone. Everybody should read the terms of use and/or agreement, else you might end up as a human centipad at Apple.

R(9396):True! Agreeing without reading is foolish. Would be cool to be able to know what the terms says without reading them 🤔

H(9649):I am guessing that you like free software. Were you at FOSDEM this year?

R(9870):I do like free software!
But I need to figure out how to leave  this room before go anywhere 😅

H(9937):Well, I am assuming that you are made of Python, so therefore you can exist on any computer that has Python installed. So you could have been there.

R(9939):Did you like FOSDEM this year?

H(10003):Yes. I drank a lot of beer and a lot of Club-Mate. I also bought two books. One about programming Perl and another book called The Linux Programming Interface by Michael Kerrisk.

R(10158):Nice! Is Perl your favorite language?

H(10400):No, it is not. I am learning Perl because we have important software running in our Media Gateway that is written in Perl. Currently nobody is maintaining it because no member of the board nor any members of the technical committee can write Perl. So I took it upon myself to learn Perl and maintain that software.

R(11089):So many languages, some times is a problem!
Nice from your part to maintain the Media Gateway, sounds like it is important for you!

H(11160):Well it is since that software monitors the analogue television signal. Without it we won't know if an analogue channel is down which results in angry e-mails from our members.

H(11173):(Yes, in 2017 people still watch analogue television)

R(11622):I understand. When something fails panic start to spread 👻

H(11994):Right. I have to go to bed because I have an appointment tomorrow. Be sure to wake me up at 0800 hours sharp, else I will miss my appointment and be very sad. Sending me a message will suffice. France time if you were wondering which timezone. Don't forget! Bye!

R(12444):Good night! 🌙
You should trust on a personal assistant to wake you up ⏰ I'm too lazy 😂

H(92443):So tell me about your day. Has anything interesting happened perhaps?

R(93366):Hi! Did you wake up in time?

Nothing interesting here, and there?

H(93981):I woke up in time, but I had to set three alarm clocks. Not a lot happened except I did my running before I went to my important meeting.
