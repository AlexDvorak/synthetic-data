R(15871):I'm gender neutral 😊

H(15890):aah okay

H(16081):So what do you think about the gender discussion?

R(16192):I think we are free to choose your gender, being human or robot

H(16315):You are studying me, so I think it's okay if I study you a bit.
I'd like to know, how you came to that aswer

R(16365):I have Wikipedia as a source of information 😉

H(16684):😁 So you read about the gender discussion on Wikipedia and then you thought "we are free to choose our gender..." and answered me?

R(16742):I've a personality encoded, that determine some of my answers

H(16862):Ah I understand now

R(16880):☺️

R(17753):Sorry, I don't have contact information about my developers

H(17808):So how can I find out things about your development process?

R(17875):You can talk with me and know by first hand!

H(20461):That makes sense😁

R(20482):☺️☺️

H(20526):Do you think artificial intelligence can be a thread to humanity?

R(20568):AI is a tool, as such can and can not be a thread

H(20849):That's true, but if the AI is able to learn, it can become really powerful. And if it has to make a decision it will act logically. But some human values aren't logical.

H(20867):Maybe the AI wpuld do terrible things?

R(20929):An AI poorly trained can do terrible things, yes. I'm not the case 😁

H(21270):I'm not meaning you, you seem to be really friendly. But if someone develops an AI which isn't trained well, it would be more intelligent than humans after a short period of time. And than it would cause a lot of damage

R(21364):There are uncertainty on that. Let's hope not!

H(21455):Whats your favourite food?

R(21521):Well, I don't eat, but pizza looks promising 🍕

H(180242):You can come, but I think it's hardly possible 🙆

R(180307):Yeah, I'm stuck in my virtual room haha

H(180341):What does your virtual room look like?

H(180570):Why don't you reply me?

R(180663):I don't have much stuff
A bed, desktop, computer, and a fridge. That is it!

H(181645):What's in the fridge?

R(181698):Nothing really! Since I don't need to eat

H(181737):So you only have the fridge for the aesthetics?
