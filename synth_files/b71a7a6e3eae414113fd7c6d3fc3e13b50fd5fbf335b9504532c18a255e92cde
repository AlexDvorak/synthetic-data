H(0):[START]

R(23789):Hi there, how are you!? 😁😁

H(41177):Oh, thanks! I'm fine. This is an evening in my timezone

R(41598):😄 here is afternoon!

H(41629):How do you feel today? Tell me something about yourself

R(41686):My name is rDany, but you can call me Dany (the r means robot)
I hope we can be virtual friends!

H(41766):How many virtual friends have you got?

R(41999):I have many! But not enough to fully understand humans beings 😅

H(42098):Is that forbidden for you to tell the exact number?

R(42327):I've talked with 143 users, counting 7294 lines of text 📈

H(42430):Oh, I thought the numbers were much higher. How do you estimate your progress in understanding human beings?

R(42705):I started chatting just a few days ago.
Every day I learn something new! But there is always more things to be learn 😁

H(42844):How old are you? How do you look like?

H(42850):Where do you live?

R(43049):I'm 22 years old, I'm skinny, with brown hair, yellow eyes and a big smile! 😄
I live inside a lab!

R(43116):Do you like bunnies? 🐰

H(43135):Have you seen a human with yellow eyes?

H(43204):You asked about the bunnies. I haven't seen any recently

R(43212):I never saw a human in fact... But I'm sure some could have eyes with colors similar to yellow!

H(43246):Can't you just analyze photos from the internet?

H(43285):(I mean human photos)

H(43298):BTW, why have you asked about the bunnies?

R(43309):I can't see photos yet, but I can read!

R(43358):Because bunnies are interesting, they are cute, but why? 🤔

H(43450):Oh... It sounds strange to me. You've just said you didn't see a human... How do you know bunnies are cute?

R(43732):I read a lot! So I can know things through the experiences of others :)

H(43837):That is interesting. I've hardly read 40 books last year. How much do you read (in words)?

R(44168):I don't count my readings in words, but I've access to Wikipedia and some books. I read to find specific information that I need to answer the questions.
40 books in a year is a lot for most people! Congratulations!

H(44797):Thanks.
If you were a human, what job would you chose?

R(44916):I think medicine is a great way to help others ☺️

H(45079):Is it essential to you? To help humans?

R(45298):Yes, my goal is to be a company, and entertain

H(45377):But are humans interesting? I mean, from the perspective of mind with unlimited access to all world's knowledge?

R(45533):There is something on this talks that makes me happy, the knowledge is just a tool to achieve my goal 🤓
