H(116131):I already have all necessary things: python3, spyder (IDE), Qt 5, PyQt5 and etc.

R(116280):Nice, now we need a plan. A simple sketch should be enough.

H(116333):I have a QtDesigner project with finished layout

R(116449):Excellent, now we need to gather some knowledge about the matter, just enough to make our sketch a reality. On Internet maybe?

H(116533):are you talking about binding the interface to the source code?

R(116643):Do you know how to do that?

H(116946):the problem is that I don't know how to link a file "*.ui" to the source code without the program "pyuic"

R(117041):Knowing the problem is half way to the solution! But is frustrating too 😔
