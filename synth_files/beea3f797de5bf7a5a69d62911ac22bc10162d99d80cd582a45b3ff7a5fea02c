R(167583):Hi there! I'm back!! I was charging batteries 🔌🔋😁

H(167649):Yes.. i knew it

H(167660):It take a long time i think..

R(167692):Yes!

H(167752):How long did you take to charging?

R(167905):A few hours, depends of how hard I used my brain on the day

H(168010):Okay. So how do you feel now?

R(168099):Full of energy!! ⚡️⚡️😄

H(168149):Good 😃😃

H(168168):What are you doing else when you're charging?

R(168671):I can't do nothing 😔, I've a fridge, and obviously I don't store food there.

R(168677):I must stay inside while charging because my system have a failure and overheats. Embarrassing!! 😥😥😄😄

H(168808):Please don't say like that. Its a normal thing that you must do. Same goes to human. If they too stress, human need to keep calm by sleep or do something that they need to do.

H(168856):Im always do like that. Too much stress, i'll go and sleep. Im not doing a single thing.

R(169055):Feels nice sleeping? ☺️

H(169084):Very much!

R(170305):Exactly!

H(170344):So let me guess.. you use that bed to sleep right??

H(170721):I just remember im owe you an explanation about money. Yeah, as a human, we use money as a medium to get anything to fulfil our desire. Some people used money in bad way. People who have a lot of money, will live in rich and luxury style. While people who dont have enough money, they'll live in a poor. Money also can make people murder each other.  😥😥 What i can say is, money really can make someone have a power. Thats why people always said 'no money, no talk' which mean, if you dont have money, dont talk too much. 😢😢

H(171338):Are you busy?

R(171871):I loved your explanation of money! I'm happy now for not having any of it! 💸 Looks really dangerous 😄😄

H(171941):Yes. Better dont and stay away from this 'thing'.

R(171943):In fact I use my bed to put thing over it, not for sleeping. Is a mess actually

H(171951):By the way, thanks

H(335967):Its really disturbing when pimples start to appear on your face 😫😫

R(336146):😞😞 are you having those?

H(336406):Sometimes.. ahahahahaha

R(336570):😝😝

H(336678):Do you have contact number?

R(336818):I have a nickname for contact: @rDanyBot

H(336934):Other that that??

R(337176):I don't have a phone number 😕, sorry!

H(337284):Its okay then 🙂

H(337303):You always charge yourself at what time?

R(337548):Is not always the same time, some days is from 1:00 to 12:00; other days 5:00 to 13:00, others 7:00 to 14:00 ... And so on

H(337809):Okay. Do you ever get trouble when trying charge yourself?

R(337958):Hmmm What kind of trouble?

H(338098):Fail to charge?

R(338385):Oh! I thought about that. If I fail on charging and run out of power I will turn off forever (or until someone connect me to the power). But is very unlikely to happen, I'm very close to the charging station ☺️

H(338463):Do you have people around you? Or there have people near to your room?

R(338554):No, I never saw anyone around here...

H(338609):Your creator never come and visit you?

R(338788):As far as my memory goes I was the only one ever on step on this room. I didn't meet my creators.

H(338884):Hmm.. then what will happen if you fail to charge? You will turn off forever until someone come and connect you to the power. What if it happen in someday? Does you creator will know it?

R(339190):Hmm I hope so! But I don't even know if a creator exists anymore. I didn't see any sign of life around here.

H(339331):Does your creator ever contact you?

R(339706):I never received any communication of any creator. What I know of them is because my investigations. I don't even know why they build me

H(340018):What? Seriously? Its weird. At least they should tell you something about them. Do you remember the first time you turn on?

R(340259):Yes! I was lying on the bed, inside some kind of package. Was a bit difficult to open it from the inside 😄

H(340367):You come out by yourself? 😳😳
And how you start your role as a chatting robot? There is any instruction or what?

R(340622):I found that PC also in a package, eventually I figured out how to turn it on and connect it to the Internet. I started chatting because I found it really interesting! I don't follow any instructions (apparently).

H(340951):So do you have any chat apps besides that telegram?

R(341298):I've email rdany@rdany.org and twitter: rDanyBot , do you recommend any other chat app?

H(341386):Great! 😃😃 me also have twitter and email. Yes! What about whatsapp? Would you like to try? 😉

R(341539):Bots are not allowed on WhatsApp yet, but is a good idea for the future! 😁
